                Hello,</p>

            <p>
                I'm Mohammed Sbihi, a passionate individual obsessed with cybersecurity. Currently in my third
                year of engineering studies at ENSAF, I am dedicated to honing my skills in the ever-evolving field of
                cybersecurity. My journey involves exploring platforms like TryHackMe, Hack The Box, and participating
                in challenges like picoCTF to enhance my expertise.
            </p>
            <p>
                Simultaneously, I wear the hat of a junior Android application developer, proficient in Java for native
                development and Flutter for cross-platform applications. Combining my cybersecurity knowledge with my
                development skills, I strive to create secure and robust mobile applications.

            </p>
            <p>
                Feel free to explore my portfolio to learn more about my projects and the exciting world where
                cybersecurity and mobile development intersect.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's connect and explore the possibilities at the intersection of cybersecurity and cutting-edge
                technology!
